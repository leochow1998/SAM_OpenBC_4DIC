This txt outlined the change to the SAM 6.10.4 source code
since 2023-03-27
with an aim to let SAM read 4D data from CAM history file output
in order to initialize the run

----------------------------------------------------------------------
plan 1 (20230328)
1. set the snd file to an average of z, p, tp, q values from the CAM data,
   and the u, v to 0
   (need to check whether u0 and v0, ug0, vg0 are used apart from nudging)
2. set the grd file to be the corresponding height value
   of the pressure level of CAM at the initial timestep
3. add the read CAM 3D data after initialize 3D initial condition in
   file: setdata.f90
4. run SAM

or 
plan 2
1. run the SAM with snd file z, p, tp, q values from the CAM data
   and the u, v setted to 0, with the grd file to be the 
   corresponding height value of the pressure level in CAM
2. archive the restart file
3. after read_all(), diagnose(), setparm(), add a file to replace
   3D variables in SAM to be the output from CAM
4. run SAM
(p.s the diagnose() subroutine computes the vertical profile by area averaging
 across the whole domain (Cartecian coordinate, so just sum and divide by num. of grids))

comments: (leo, 20230329)
as plan 2 also use a domain average to compute the vertical profiles,
plan 1 provide a larger flexibility, and therefore plan 1 is prefered 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
adopted plan (20230509)
1. add the read CAM 3d data after initialize 3Dinitial condition and
microphysics variables in file setdata.f90 and microphysics.f90
(the file is named read4dcaminput.f90)
2. recompute the diagnostic profiles related to the microphysics variables

added the namelist variables docam4diopdata at the back of the namelist PARAMETERS

initialize the namelist variable docam4diopdata in grid.f90

add the call read4dcaminput.f90 after micro_init and microphyscics diagnostic profile calculation
in setdata.f90, and recompute the microphysics diagnostic profiles

debug completed, successfully build (20230509)

add the iopfile4d character variables to the grid.f90,
and the iopfile4d namelist variables to the PARAMETERS namelist in setparm.f90

debug completed, successfully build (20230509)

added case(3) in simple_ocean.f90, which is Qobs10 profile
debug completed, successfully build (20230510)
haven't check whether the answer of the sst is correct

modified the domain size to 9720 * 2500 * 28

20230523
in rad.f90, add dummyTauAerosolLW = 0. before rrtmg_lw to zero out the aerosol cloud effect on radiation
in rad,f90, add dummyAerosolProps = 0. and dummyAerosolProps2 = 0. before rrtmg_sw to zero out the aerosol cloud effect on shout wave radiation
in order to match the change in CAM RRTM scripts

20230629
modified read4dcaminput.f90 to send variables from rank=0 to subranks
modified the domain size to 9720 * 2160 * 28

20230914
added parameters in NAMELIST: (setparm.f90 (setparm_new.f90))
1. dodampinglateral: logical to do lateral damping along y boundary or not
2. micro_out_freq: control the output frequency of hydrometer species (except Qv),
   to be # times of nsave3D
3. micro_nx_out: logical to control whether to output the hydrometer concentration N*
added the corresponding variables in params.f90
edited the printout.f90 (printout_new.f90) for checking
