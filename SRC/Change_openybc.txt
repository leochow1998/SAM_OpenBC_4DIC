#### mark down the changed made due to changing the yBL to 
# open boundary condition for gravity wave

1. main_new.f90:
1.1. added parameter doopeny (logical): check the condition to use open yBL
     if doopeny, dowally = .true.
     then modify all dowally conditions
1.2. call subroutine exchange_bl after boundaries(0) to replace the 
     v at the northmost grid with the backup v
     p.s. originally, the code just use PBC to fill up the northmost grid
          using the southmost grid
     p.s2. after the boundaries(0), the script surface() need to use the 
           v at the northmost for second order differencing
1.3. zeroout all the backup fields for next timestep before updating the
     AB-scheme indices
1.4  at the begining of each ncycle, back up the prognostic variables
     and shift the ncurr and nprev indices

2. params.f90: 
added definition of parameter: doopeny (logical) = .false.

3. vars.f90: (vars_new2.f90 for temparary testing)
3.1. defining variable: vnorthmost (real)
     to back up the v at the current timestep at the northmost grid
3.2. defining variable: dvdtnorthmost (real)
     to backup the dvdt at the current timestep at the northmost grid
3.3. defining variable: ubackup, vbackup, wbackup (real)
     to backup the u,v,w at the current timestep
     before updating it at the adams.f90 to the next timestep

3. damping_lateral.f90:
seperately treat the damping of v at y = nyp1 (northmost grid cell for v 
in Arakawa C grid, if no MPI), assuming the damping coefficient at y=nyp1 is equal
to that at y=nyp1. damp the dvdt(nx,nyp1,nzm,na) by 
Ry(i,ny,k) * v(i,nyp1,k)
(here, we retain the lateral damping at the y BLs)

4. damping.f90:
for verical damping gravity wave reflection at the top of the model, 
seperately treat the damping of v at y = nyp1 (northmost grid for v in 
Arakawa C grid, if no MPI), damp the dvdt(i,ny+1,k,na) by the same 
amount with other grids
(here, we retain the vertical damping at the y BLs)

5. advect_mom.f90 (advect_mom_new.f90)
add the advection of nonnormal momentum along y direction, i.e. 
py(vu) and py(vw) at the southmost and the northmost grid
by calling advection_nonnormal_momentum in module open_boundary_y.f90.
P.s. the idea of doing this is we keep the consistancy of the previous code, 
     which is to advect the momentum using 2nd order advection scheme. However,
     we replace the dudt and dwdt with that before the advection of momentum in
     y dir by backing up the previous values, and seperately calculate the
     advection of momentum at the y BLs (southmost and northmost) by ourselves

In pressure_big.f90
6. press_rhs.f90 (press_rhs_new.f90)
6.1. read from the backup of dvdt at the northmost and southmost boundary to
     overwrite the effect of the original wall yBL
6.2. compute the open y boundary condition at the northmost and the southmost
     boundary, backup the values to dvdtnorthmost and dvdtsouthmost

7. press_grad.f90 (press_grad_new.f90)
read from the backup of dvdt at the northmost and southmost y boundary to 
overwrite the effect of the original wall yBC

8. adams.f90
8.1. seperately compute the v at the next timestep at the northmost y boundary,
     for the southmost boundary, the v and dvdt(i,1,k,na) already contains the 
     necessary information (damping effect) for computation
8.2. backup the current timestep u,v,w to ubackup,vbackup,wbackup

9. advect_all_scalars.f90
backup the scalars to scalarbackup, seperately compute the advection of scalars
using second order upwind scheme in open_boundary_y, then replace the value of 
y = 1 and y = ny in the scalars
scalars: t, micro_fields, sgs_fields

10. uvw.f90
seperately restore the v at ny+1 from dimensionless form to that
obtained by the open boundary condition

11. kunurt.f90 (kunurt_new.f90): debug only
print out the maximum w, horizontal wind, and the corresponding counurt number
for stability check

12. setparm.f90 (setparm_new.f90):
add the doopeny options to the NAMELIST

13. params.f90 (params_new.f90):
define doopeny and initialize it as .false.

14. printout.f90 (printout_new.f90):
printout the doopeny value for checking
