the com3D2nc NF_CREATE uses NF_CLOBBER (default) as the CMODE (version of the
nc file create), which the default is netcdf3-CLASSIC
in NETCDF3-CLASSIC, only one variable can exceed 2GiB in size, so only the
first variable in the com3D file (U wind) is written to nc file

to change this behavior, the com3D2nc_new.f file is written, with
NF_CREATE(PATH, NF_NETCDF4, ...), so as to change the nc file format to
netcdf4, which has unlimited max file size and max number of fixed vars

therefore, the netcdf-c and netcdf-fortran installed need to support netcdf4,
with HDF5 support
